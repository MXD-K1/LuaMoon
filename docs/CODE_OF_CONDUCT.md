# Code of Conduct
## Purpose
LuaMoon is an open-source package manager for the Lua ecosystem. Its purpose is to provide a simple, transparent, 
and reliable way to discover, install, and manage Lua libraries across different projects and platforms.

LuaMoon is developed as a community-driven project. Contributions are intended to improve usability, correctness,
performance, and documentation while preserving clarity and long-term maintainability. The project does not aim to 
replace existing tools by force, but to explore alternative design decisions and provide additional value 
to the Lua ecosystem.

## Guidelines

- Treat all contributors, maintainers, and users with respect and professionalism. Discussions should focus on 
ideas, code, design decisions, and documentation—not individuals.
- Provide feedback that is constructive, specific, and relevant to the project’s goals and technical direction. 
Explain reasoning or suggest alternatives rather than just saying something is “wrong.”
- Disagreements are natural, but they must remain technical and civil. Personal attacks, harassment, 
discriminatory or hateful language, trolling, spam, or disruptive behavior are not tolerated.
- Requests, suggestions, and feature proposals should be made thoughtfully and without pressure or demands. 
LuaMoon is a volunteer-led project, and timelines or feature inclusion are not guaranteed.
- Respect the project’s maintainers’ decisions. If a change or idea is not accepted, discuss it politely 
or propose alternatives without escalating conflict.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Discussions and comments
- Any interaction directly related to this project
